<h1>ML_implementations</h1>
<p>
	Machine learning algorithm (or part of them) implemented in python during the module <i>Pattern Recognition, Neural Networks and Deep Learning</i> at King's College, London.
</p>
<p>
	These implementations and were ment to solve toy problems for the module's assignments. The idea was to write the code in an understandable way more than focusing on the optimisation. I used them as a tool to understand how each algorithm worked.
</p>
<p>
	For the same reason, I choose to use jupyter notebooks instead of plain python, in order to comment each step and to have major control on my experiments.
</p>
<p>
	Some notebooks only contain useful functions like the check for linear separability, or how tos, like PCA and LDA.
